# Dev-Forum

Dev Forum, is small social network, basically we can look at profiles, register/login, create our own profile on which
we can add our work experience, and education. We can add post, and comments (only if we have profile), and like other 
posts and comments. On Developers page you can see all profiles which are register in the site, when you click on them 
you can see more information about the user, if he added his github name, you can see his latest github repos. We have access
control via JWT, the token is stored in local storage. The forum is using by default Gravatar (if you register with gmail on which you have avatar, it gonna take it from it automatically.
